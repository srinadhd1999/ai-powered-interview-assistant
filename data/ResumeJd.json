  "rationale": "The candidate's experience as a Systems Software Engineer at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, along with skills in Git, Jenkins, Helm Charts, Salt-Ssh, Kubernetes, Docker, Shell scripting, Python, and Ansible, align more closely with DevOps/Infrastructure Engineering roles rather than Data Engineering. While there is some overlap in skills like Kubernetes and Docker, the lack of specific data-related experience or projects indicates a mismatch with the Data Engineering job description."
